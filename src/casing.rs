//! Crossing casing (G1): where two edges must cross, the one going
//! UNDER gets a small gap cut out of its stroke on both sides of the
//! other, so the crossing reads as one line passing beneath another
//! instead of a blot.
//!
//! The gap is an SVG `<mask>` per under-edge (a white box with a black
//! disc at each crossing), so it shows on frames and on a transparent
//! canvas alike, where a background-coloured halo would not. A diagram
//! without crossings gets no masks and renders byte-identically.
//!
//! Which edge goes under is chosen per crossing, so that no edge
//! collects a run of closely spaced gaps: a stroke cut every few dozen
//! px reads as dashed, and a dashed edge means `-.->` in mermaid.
