//! Ready-to-draw geometry for interactive apps (drag & drop
//! editors, hit-testing, export). Every coordinate in this module
//! is FINAL (screen pixels, already following the diagram
//! direction) — unlike the abstract coordinates inside `layout`.
//!
//! Typical drag & drop flow:
//! 1. `scene(&graph)` — automatic layout + edge geometry.
//! 2. Keep node positions in app state; draw with your painter.
//! 3. When a node is dragged, call `route(&graph, &positions)` to
//!    recompute edge curves for the new positions (edge direction
//!    classification follows actual relative positions, not layers).
//! 4. `to_svg(&scene)` exports any arrangement to SVG.
