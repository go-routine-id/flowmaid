//! Stage 1 of [`crate::edgepass::finish`]: port assignment (G9).
//!
//! The builders anchor each edge end on its own, so edges heading the
//! same way leave one node side from (nearly) one point, and an
//! incoming arrowhead can land right on an outgoing edge's start. Here
//! every drawn end is grouped by the side of the node (or frame) it
//! touches; each group is ordered by where its edges head, so the spread
//! ends never make their curves cross at the node, and then placed with
//! the smallest total move that keeps neighbouring ends a port spacing
//! apart (an isotonic fit) inside the usable part of the side.
